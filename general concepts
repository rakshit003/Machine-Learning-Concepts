*****vectorization******

f= w1x1+w2x2.....wnxn + b
can be implemented as dot prodcut of w and x
f=w.x+b
dot prduct is nothing but sum of product of corresponding numbes in each vectors.

this is much more efficent to implement and can be implemented in parellal with help of GPUs

or else we have to implement it using for loops which is much slower
