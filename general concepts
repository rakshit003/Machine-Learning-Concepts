*****vectorization******

f= w1x1+w2x2.....wnxn + b
can be implemented as dot prodcut of w and x
f=w.x+b
dot prduct is nothing but sum of product of corresponding numbes in each vectors.

this is much more efficent to implement and can be implemented in parellal with help of GPUs
or else we have to implement it using for loops which is much slower. like below

for j in range(0 to 16 features):
 f= f w[j]*x[j]

How Vectorization is faster?
multiplication of numbers can be performed in parellel and laters summed up in a single step.
Hence it scales well with large dataset

Where as for loop does acummulated sum, where in every loop iteration gthe accumulated count gets
updated
