****Multi class classification in Nural net

Logistic Regression is a generalization of softmax regressign, for n=2
In order to achive multiclass in nuralnet we add a softmax function multi node only in the output layer 
a1= e^z1/e^z1+e^z2+.....e^zn   -- n is number of classes
all the other layer remain same as normal NN with 2 classes

****Difference Between Loss and Cost Function
Loss function is defined for only 1 row(example) of the data set and a give point in time gives the loss of inputted row
Cost function is for all records. Its an average of loss of each record of the dataset, 
Gradient decent plots cost function against model weights and minimise the cost by adjusting the weights slowly

*****making multi class datatset for testing

# make 4-class dataset for classification
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
classes = 4
m = 100
centers = [[-5, 2], [-2, -2], [1, 2], [5, -2]]
std = 1.0
X_train, y_train = make_blobs(n_samples=m, centers=centers, cluster_std=std,random_state=30)
plt_mc(X_train,y_train,classes, centers, std=std)
