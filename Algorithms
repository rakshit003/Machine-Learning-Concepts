***Gradient Decent****

Gradient Decent helps you arrive at the lost value of a cost function but adjusting its parmaters in stepwise systematic way.
J(W,b) function needs to be minimized with respect to parameters W(w1,w2,w3..wn) and b. Gradient decent uses derivatives at
each step to indentify the steepest decent at that moment and update the parameter most which causes the steepest decent

For linear regression J(w,b) is a squared error function hence its shape is a bow or hammock shape, which always have a single minima
for J(w,b) will not always have a bow/hammock shape , as a result it could have local and global minima as well. 
In Nural Net we get multiple minimas in cost function

for eg the image of a hill range(or a golf park) like structure in a 3d plot is not a squared error cost function since it has many rough and troughs
like we get in nural net.

At a give moment in the park , gradient decent asks in what direction should i take the next baby step in order to decent the steepest.
Hence based on where we start , we can endup in different local minimas in a gradient decent algorithm if we don't have a bow shape cost function.
