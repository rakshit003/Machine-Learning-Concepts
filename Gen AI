RAG:
RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation is an important technique 
that is enabling many LLMs to have context or to have information beyond what it may have learned on the open Internet

for eg if your company has multiple internal policy documents for employees
RAG can help find the information in those docs by first providing more context to your question to your question
and then answer it

Usecase: Chat with PDF
